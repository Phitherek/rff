rff - A Ruby gem for simple audio and video conversion for HTML5 using FFmpeg

If you are tired of outdated, not working gems for dealing with audio and video conversion? Are you looking for something simple to convert media files in your Rails application to HTML5 formats? If so, then rff is just what you need!

The idea behind rff is to be simple media converting gem based on FFmpeg providing basic functionality for converting various media files so they can be displayed in HTML5 audio and video tags, providing command output and also parsing it to extract information about the status of conversion process (eg. percentage done, length of processed file etc.).

This is a work in progress...
