rff - A Ruby gem for simple audio and video conversion for HTML5 using FFmpeg

Are you tired of outdated, not working gems for dealing with audio and video conversion? Are you looking for something simple to convert media files in your Rails application to HTML5 formats? If so, then rff is just what you need!

The idea behind rff is to be simple media converting gem based on FFmpeg providing basic functionality for converting various media files so they can be displayed in HTML5 audio and video tags, providing command output and also parsing it to extract information about the status of conversion process (eg. percentage done, length of processed file etc.).

The first 0.1 version of the gem is now finished! Documentation, wiki etc. will follow soon. But just so you know:

- The default arguments of the processor and handlers have been set to provide quite good quality of audio and video by default (unlike FFmpeg' s defaults). However, they are fully customizable by method options.
- The handlers are still quite experimental and
 1) I have done everything I can for them not to fail most of the time.
 2) The fire_sequential method should work fine in most cases.
 3) The fire_all method is VERY EXPERIMENTAL now, as it is known that somehow outputs of various commands mix with each other breaking the parsers. It sometimes works, but use it at your own risk.
- There are automatic RSpec tests in spec subdirectory and also some manual/custom tests in simpletests directory.
- Any help with the known and not yet known issues is appreciated, even simple feedback.

I hope you find rff useful and enjoyable to use!
